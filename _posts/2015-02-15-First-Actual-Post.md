I've never written anything. Well, there were thousands pages of technical documentation, but it's something definitely another.

Writing a blog should help me to understand what's going on in my head for last many weeks. Although I don't have anything interesting to share, I'm not sad, beacuse I'm mostly going to write for myself.

What I need to write
-
Recently I read a book called "Black city" by Boris Akunin. Erast Fandorin made a so called
[nikki](https://www.quora.com/What-stands-behind-the-tradition-of-writing-Nikki-Japanese-diary-What-are-the-different-styles-that-can-be-chosen-for-that). There was a poetic story behind the simple japanese diary, and that was not the best part in the book.

But I like the general idea of writing a diary.

The format
-
It must be something short. I just do not understand how a man could write long stories. It is too dificult for me.

Everything which comes into my head. Short.
