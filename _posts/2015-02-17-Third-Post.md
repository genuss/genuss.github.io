Making up a name is the most dificult part of anything, when you need a name.
At least for me: I can develop complicated system, write a lot of documentation,
make comprehensive research, but make up a name even for this blog was very hard.
Actually words "ice cream" was the first came to my mind. That's why I give names
to posts by adding a unity to each new one.

Looks like my thoughts are coming to the end. Pretty fast, even for my assumptions.
But we'll fight all dificulties and write at least a week or two.
