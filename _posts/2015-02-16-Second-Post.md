I often think I have so many thoughts in my head, that I can concentrate.
This is often untrue because if I write them down,
there are actually no more than seven. The mysterious and amazing human brain
can handle only seven things? The brain, which has built kilometers length bridges,
huge ships, reached the air and space, deciphered genom can only handle
seven entities in a row. Isn't that disapointing or it makes itself even more
astonishing?

I suppose the second. The most amazing in history of mankind is how
a man can achieve all the results with this may I say mediocre instrument?
With all the obstacles, instead of his non-ideality a man goes ahead and
never back.
